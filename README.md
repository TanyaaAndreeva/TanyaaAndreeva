****About ME****

 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, everyone!
 
 ![hello](https://media.tenor.com/pvFJwncehzIAAAAM/hello-there-private-from-penguins-of-madagascar.gif)
 
Iâ€™m Tanya Andreeva.
I recently graduated from the Automation Quality Assurance Program at [SoftUni](https://github.com/SoftUni).
I am highly motivated to explore the QA field and deepen my knowledge of automation testing.
In this profile, you'll find some of my graduation projects and personal learning challenges.

- ðŸ‘€  Iâ€™m interested in exploring automation testing tools, especially getting to know the **Selenium family** better â€“ Selenium WebDriver, Selenium Grid, and more!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **API testing** with Postman & Playwright.

- âš¡ Fun fact: My sharp attention to detail comes from years of working in customer service â€“ now I'm channeling it into catching bugs instead of customer complaints!
